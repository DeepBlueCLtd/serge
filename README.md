## Serge

### Offline Installation

The Serge application runs with a NodeJS backend server. When a NodeJS application is configured & installed, it traditionally downloads a up to date versions of all of its dependencies.  To allow Serge to run on a PC that lacks an Internet connection, perform the following:

1. Gain access to a PC of the same operating system as the destination PC
2. Unpack Serge
3. From the top level folder, run `npm run save-modules` to download and install the front and backend dependencies
4. Zip up this installation
5. Unzip the installation on the destination PC
6. From the top level folder, run `npm run offline-install` - this will install the dependencies in the correct locations

### Installing as a service
On a MS Windows PC, Serge can be installed as a service - meaning it starts whenever that machine starts.  Perform this by executing `installSergeService.bat`.  Windows will popup up a series of confirmation boxes to approve the installation. On completion, Serge will be installed under MS Windows as `Serge Server`.   You can find the script to uninstall the service.  It's not imaginagively named.

### For development
The live demo version of Serge requires a hard-coded path to the backend server.

This path is configured from the top-level `.env` data-file, according to the `locally` and `heroku` sections further down.
